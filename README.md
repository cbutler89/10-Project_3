About: Project 3
==================

This assignment was to independently explore and research an area within the field of 3D fabrication. With my senior thesis project in mind, I chose to create a mountable webcam enclosure. I used a digital caliper to get accurate measurments of a webcam, which I used to render a model of it in OpenSCAD. The webcam model was used to create a two-piece mold. The mold was held together using four 1/4" screws and hex nuts. It can be mounted with a drill and one or two additional 1/4" screws. It was printed with ABS.
